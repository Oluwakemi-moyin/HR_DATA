### Project Overview
---
Collection and analysis of HR data across the company's various educational fields, attrition rate, cf_age band. The goal of the project is to provide insights into number of attrition, attrition rate, number of current employees and Job satistaction rate for the data period. The analysis focuses on understanding attrition trends across various departments and age-group and calculating key performance indicators like; total number of attrition, rate of attrition, number of current employees and job satisfaction rate.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
1. Power BI:
   - Transform data was used for cleaning the dataset.
   - Conditional Column(DAX Function) - Count of Attrition
     ```
     Formula:
     IF Count Attrition equals 'Yes' then 1
              else 0
   
     ```
   - Conditional Column(DAX Function) - Age Sort
     ```
     Formula:
     IF Age-band is 'Under 25' then  1
     IF Age-band is '25-34' then  2
     IF Age-band is '35-44' then  3
     IF Age-band is '45-54' then  4
     IF Age-band is 'Over 55' then  5
     ```
   - Calculated Measure- Rate of Attrition
      ```
     Formula: Count of Attrition / Total number of employees
   
     ```
   - Card, Charts, Matrix, Tables,ets - for visualizations       
     
                                                                                            |A|
