### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
1. Power BI:
   - Transform data  was used for cleaning the dataset.
   - Conditional Column(DAX Function) - Count of Attrition
     ```
     Formula:
     IF Count Attrition equals 'Yes' then 1
              else 0
   
     ```
   - Conditional Column(DAX Function) - Age Sort
     ```
     Formula:
     IF Age-band is 'Under 25' then  1
     IF Age-band is '25-34' then  2
     IF Age-band is '35-44' then  3
     IF Age-band is '45-54' then  4
     IF Age-band is 'Over 55' then  5
     ```
   - Calculated Measure- Rate of Attrition
      ```
