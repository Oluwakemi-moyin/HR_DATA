  1. For Data cleaning,
  2. Analysis and
  3. Visualization

2. Job satisfaction rating
3. Total number of current employees
4. Attrition rate

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
1. Power BI:
   - Transform data was used for cleaning the dataset.
   - Conditional Column(DAX Function) - Number of attrition
     ```
     Formula:
     IF Attrition equals 'Yes' then 1
              else 0
   
     ```
   - Conditional Column(DAX Function) - Age Sort
     ```
     Formula:
     IF Age-band is '15-44' then  1
     IF Age-band is '15-44' then  2
     IF Age-band is '15-44' then  3
     IF Age-band is '15-44' then  4
     ```
   - Calculated Measure- Rate of Attrition
      ```
     Formula: Number of Attrition / Total number of employees
   
     ```
   - Card, Charts, Matrix, Tables,ets - for visualizations       
     
                                                                                            |A|
